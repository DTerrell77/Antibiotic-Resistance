About The Project:
---------------
Antibiotic Resistance Website: [Antibiotic-Resistance](https://antibioticresistance2018.carrd.co/)

Antibiotic Resistance is a very important and serious issue all across the world. It will be a reoccurring problem for the world until there are better advancements for antibiotics to become more effective against different types of pathogens in the Medical field. This website is a product of the research that was done on Antimicrobial Resistance for a Data Science class. Our goal is to spread knowledge of antimicrobial resistance through several visualizations that we created.

Getting Started:
---------------
In order to clone this repository and start analyzing the data in RStudio, then you must install these packages first:

* install.packages("shiny")
* install.packages("shinydashboard")
* install.packages("stringr")
* install.packages("maps")
* install.packages("ggplot2")
* install.packages("dplyr")
* install.packages("tidyr")

* Note that when you load the data, RStudio might ask you to install the packages and install them for you
* The code for all of the visualizations is listed as "Final Project.Rmd"
* The Shiny app can be found in the "Final Project" folder listed as "app.R". This file can be opened in RStudio

Things to Note:
---------------
* This repo contains the final presentation under the "Final Presentation" folder which also contains all of our visualizations
* This repo contains the final paper under the "Final Paper" folder
* This repo contains the code to the Shiny app and to all of the visualizations
* This repo also contains a html file of the visualizations which was used from knit in RStudio

Future Work:
---------------
* Gather data about the percentage of cropland in the US and in the world so we can show the
spread of bacteria through agriculture.
* Create maps that shows a correlation of how agriculture can spread bacteria and become more resistant to antibiotics
* Add a US map thats shows percent resistance of different bacteria onto the Shiny App.
