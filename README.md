## About The Project

Antibiotic Resistance Website: [Antibiotic-Resistance](https://antibioticresistance2018.carrd.co/)

Antibiotic Resistance is a very important and serious issue all across the world. It will be a reoccurring problem for the world until there are better advancements for antibiotics to become more effective against different types of pathogens in the Medical field. This website is a product of the research that was done on Antimicrobial Resistance for a Data Science class. Our goal is to spread knowledge of antimicrobial resistance through several visualizations that we created.

### Getting Started:

In order to clone this repository and start analyzing the data within these files, then you must install these packages first.

* install.packages("shiny")
* install.packages("shinydashboard")
* install.packages("stringr")
* install.packages("maps")
* install.packages("ggplot2")
* install.packages("dplyr")
* install.packages("tidyr")

The main shiny dashboard application is under "final-dashboard" title "app.r". This file can be opened in Rstudio and run from the client as is.
Maps is not needed for running, but it was used to get the initial data. Dplyr and stringr are used for data manipulation. Shiny, shinydashboard, and ggplot2 are used for visualizations.

###Future Work
Gather data of percentage of cropland in the US and in the world so we can show the
spread of bacteria through agriculture 
Add a US map of the 
Gather comprehensive data on all facility populations to use population based rates.
Perform regression analysis to see if state prison cases are different from general population cases.
Gather data over time for releases in facilities to see effectiveness of releasing inmates and preventing the spread of COVID-19.
Gather data for public vs. private prisons to see if our trends follow throughout the U.S.
